    <p>This web page doesn't look good, with only HTML users can only be able to see these texts everything aligned to left. 
      However we need to make this more presentable to the users, That's where CSS comes to play. CSS takes care of the design aspects of the web page
    HTML only defines the data which is placed in the page in a browser understandable format.
    Adding CSS in an HTML makes it look aesthetically pleasing.
      By the end of this web page, we can enable CSS and look how this not so neatly arranged text becomes a great web page...
      Wait for it...
