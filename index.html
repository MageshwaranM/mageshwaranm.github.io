<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Hello HTML!</h1>
  </header>
  <div id="header">
    This is a header in div tag.
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      HELLO TO ALL...
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a web page to go through all the basic to advanced HTML elements.
      Maybe a reference page to look up whenever needed for a particular tag.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Before getting started, I would alert you that starting with only HTML makes restriction not to use CSS in the first place...
      So this page might not be an actual page like others...
    </p>
    <p>This web page doesn't look good, with only HTML users can only be able to see these texts everything aligned to left. 
      However we need to make this more presentable to the users, That's where CSS comes to play. CSS takes care of the design aspects of the web page
    HTML only defines the data which is placed in the page in a browser understandable format.
    Adding CSS in an HTML makes it look aesthetically pleasing.
      By the end of this web page, we can enable CSS and look how this not so neatly arranged text becomes a great web page...
      Wait for it...

    <div>
      <p> Before Getting into design aspects, I'll go through all the tags and elements to look after in HTML.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>
          &#60html&#62 tag:
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is the first tag which wraps all the web page. This consists of two major tags.
          Head and Body. Which classifies the data in the web page for their specific functions.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div>
        <h3>
          &#60head&#62 tag:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Head tag contatins title tag which is the name displayed in the new tab when the page loads.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>
          &#60body&#62 tag:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Body tag contains the data which is displayed in the browser window, which has the text, hyperlinks to other pages etc.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
